Development Brief

Project: Quantified Task & Productivity Tracking for Exhibition Build Operations
Owner: Bjørn
Version: v1.0 — November 2025

1. Background

The company manages build-ups and tear-downs for large-scale exhibitions and events.
Each event includes numerous vendor booths that require delivery and installation of materials such as carpet tiles, booth walls, and furniture.

Currently, task performance and labor efficiency are tracked manually or inconsistently, making it difficult to:

Accurately estimate future staffing needs

Measure productivity per crew member

Identify inefficiencies in specific work categories

This project aims to introduce quantifiable task tracking integrated with time and personnel data to establish a reliable foundation for labor planning and performance analytics.

2. Objectives

Enable accurate tracking of quantity-based work (e.g., m² of carpet, meters of walls, number of furniture items).

Calculate per-person productivity metrics based on quantity completed and time logged.

Provide clear, intuitive visual dashboards for performance insights.

Build historical data that improves future staffing estimates and scheduling accuracy.

3. Core Features
a. Task Management

Create tasks for each deliverable (e.g., “Lay 120 m² carpet tiles”).

Define quantity and unit type:

m² (area-based work)

m (linear work)

pcs (countable items)

Assign estimated duration and expected personnel count.

b. Time & Crew Tracking

Track actual time spent per task.

Record the number of workers involved.

Automatically calculate person-hours (time × personnel).

c. Productivity Calculation

Compute real productivity as:
Productivity = Quantity ÷ Person-Hours

Display in human-readable units (e.g., “12.4 m²/person-hr”).

Provide visual performance feedback (color-coded KPIs, warnings when below targets).

d. KPI Dashboard

Health app-style visualizations with bar charts per completed task.

Horizontal average line to highlight overall efficiency.

Separate cards per unit type (m², m, pcs, etc.).

Adapts to KPI date range picker (Today / This Week / This Month).

Clear empty-state messaging when no quantifiable data is available.

e. Analytics & Forecasting (Future Phase)

Aggregate historical productivity data by task type and unit.

Generate expected person-hour estimates for future events.

Support comparisons between events, crews, and task types.

4. Expected Outcomes

Accurate productivity tracking across all work types.

Reliable data-driven estimates for staffing and scheduling.

Improved visibility into crew performance and workload balance.

Foundation for predictive analytics and resource optimization.
