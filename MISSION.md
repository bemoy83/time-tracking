# TodoApp — Mobile-First Web Mission Plan

## Product Intent

TodoApp is a **mobile-first web app** for **on-the-go time tracking** during
**build-up and tear-down of exhibitions and trade fairs**.

Primary user:
- Floor manager
- Constant movement
- One-handed phone use
- Frequent interruptions
- Unstable connectivity

This app is a **work tool**, not a planner or admin dashboard.

## Core Priorities (In Order)

1. **Time tracking first**
   - One-tap start / stop
   - Active timer state always visible
   - Never lose tracked time

2. **Mobile usability**
   - Thumb-friendly
   - Large tap targets
   - Minimal navigation depth

3. **Glanceability**
   - See what is active, blocked, or done instantly
   - Color + layout over text

4. **Low cognitive load**
   - Fewer screens
   - Fewer decisions
   - Defaults over configuration

---

## UX Philosophy

- Lists = scanning
- Detail views = action
- Editing must never block timing
- Hierarchy exists, but navigation must stay shallow
- Reliability beats visual polish

---

## What This App Is NOT

- Not a productivity dashboard
- Not a complex planner
- Not desktop-first
- Not animation-heavy
- Not configuration-driven

---

## Relationship to CONTEXT.md

- `CONTEXT.md` defines **rules and constraints**
- This file defines **product direction**
- If there is conflict, **CONTEXT.md always wins**
